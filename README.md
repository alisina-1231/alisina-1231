# 👋 Hi, I’m Ali Sina Qasimi

I’m a **Service Delivery Engineer** with hands-on experience in **telecom systems, Linux, and production support**.  
I’m actively **transitioning into DevOps**, focusing on automation, cloud, and modern infrastructure tools.

I enjoy working close to systems — improving **stability, uptime, and reliability** — and building skills that move me toward a **DevOps / SRE role**.
